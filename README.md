# 3D Cancer Gene Expression Visualization

This project presents an **interactive 3D visualization** of gene expression in cancer cells. Each sphere represents a cell, colored by gene activity, highlighting tumor heterogeneity. Users can **rotate, zoom, and explore** the spatial distribution of gene expression.
